Finding an apartment New York City is an exciting experience. It can also be nothing short of overwhelming. Especially since, while there are certainly plenty of available apartments in the city, not all of them will be a good fit. You likely have in mind a long list of requirements and preferences, such as location, size, cost and amenities. As you begin your search, here are a few expert tips to keep in mind that will hopefully make the process as positive and stress-free as possible.

<strong>Know what to look for.</strong> Have all the details hammered down before you really start hitting the pavement, like what your monthly budget is for things like rent and utilities, what things are absolute deal-breakers (i.e. proximity to the subway or walking distance to your job, bedrooms vs. loft, safety of building/neighborhood, etc.) and, if you’d like, also have an idea of what features you don’t absolutely need but wouldn’t mind having.

<strong>Familiarize yourself with the neighborhoods.</strong> There are five boroughs that make up NYC (<a href="http://t.signauxsept.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs4Xb246N5vfVMld7tgKW5vMqt056dB31f51H8vn02?si=5167494290472960&amp;pi=DA0B2A57-5F68-4760-8E8D-F4C995D9F12D&amp;t=http%3A%2F%2Fen%2Ewikipedia%2Eorg%2Fwiki%2FList%5Fof%5FManhattan%5Fneighborhoods" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://t.signauxsept.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs4Xb246N5vfVMld7tgKW5vMqt056dB31f51H8vn02?si%3D5167494290472960%26pi%3DDA0B2A57-5F68-4760-8E8D-F4C995D9F12D%26t%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fen%252Ewikipedia%252Eorg%252Fwiki%252FList%255Fof%255FManhattan%255Fneighborhoods&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHK7jPXHswpIbkKhvXsJ2tt5fRguA">Manhattan, </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_neighborhoods" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_neighborhoods&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHE7khmqnm5UYoWjj5uixhy_ppUjQ">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_neighborhoods" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_neighborhoods&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNSr9q0ka7O4OWZoQF9NK5luJfIA">Queens</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bronx_neighborhoods" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bronx_neighborhoods&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPzTXb3Ixc09VTZ-GZIsV9yMRxmA">Bronx</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Staten_Island_neighborhoods" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Staten_Island_neighborhoods&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcuH4eJIlaOeSRVONB2PulTd-1Tw">Staten Island</a>), and each has its own pros and cons. Start by getting to know a little bit about each one. If you already have an idea of which area you’d prefer to live in, you can narrow your search accordingly. Keep in mind that in many cases, living just on the outskirts of a particular area might be a viable and more affordable option. For instance, you might be able to snag a place that’s bigger for less money if you look just outside of rather than actually in Manhattan.

<strong>Read between the lines.</strong> As you look through listings, it’s important to be aware that not everything you read in them will be accurate. For instance, it’s not unusual for landlords or brokers to be a little shifty when it comes to the exact location of an apartment if they think doing so will make it seem more appealing. Googling the address is the best way to know for sure. Likewise, know what deceptive terminology to look for (i.e. cozy = tiny, charming = old and unique = weird).

<strong>Do a background check.</strong> We’re not talking about checking into a person’s background. We’re talking about doing a deep dive of the potential rentals you’re considering. The resource <a href="https://www.addressreport.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.addressreport.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483735063885000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK4E5kBCzLvpl6T8DLYnmnMH9f2Q">AddressReport</a> is an excellent tool to use when you want to find out the nitty gritty about a particular property. Simply key in the address and the site will analyze millions of records to reveal unbiased information about the property and its neighborhood. Doing a little legwork upfront can save you a ton of time, hassle and aggravation in the long run.

<strong>Have a list of questions at the ready.</strong> It can be helpful to have an idea of what questions are important to ask that will help you get a better idea of what your options are and weed out those apartments that aren’t a good fit. Along with going through your checklist of must-haves, asking about things like lease options, building amenities, parking arrangements and anything else that’s pertinent to your particular situation is a good idea.

<strong>Understand that “affordability” is a relative term.</strong> Just because your monthly income is more than enough to cover the cost of rent doesn’t mean you’ll be qualified for an apartment. In reality, most NYC landlords require that tenants earn significantly more than the required rent (sometimes as much as 40 to 50 times the monthly rent amount). If you don’t happen to have that kind of income, you’ll likely be required to get a qualified guarantor who will promise to pay in the event that you default.

<strong>Budget for broker fees.</strong> One thing that surprises many new renters in NYC – particularly those who are relocating from other areas of the country – is that most apartments require the renter to pay a broker fee. There are some that don’t, but they’re much harder to find and are often either in poor condition or so high end that the owner employs his or her own leasing agents. Typically speaking, most brokers charge a fee of around 15 percent of the annual rent amount, though you may be able to negotiate that rate down, depending on the situation.

<strong>Know that there are more than just apartments to consider.</strong> Not all rental property in NYC is in apartment rental buildings. There is also the option of a co-op or rental in a condo building. Keep in mind, however, that while the latter two options may offer nicer features and amenities, they also tend to come with stricter requirements and a lot more red tape in terms of the application and approval process. Not to mention, they can also be quite a bit pricier.

<strong>Check the pet policy.</strong> If you have a pet, make sure you are upfront about it and always ask about the pet policy at each place. Some apartments welcome animal companions in exchange for an additional deposit or monthly premium. Some specify the species and size of pets they allow. Others don’t allow pets at all. You’re better off knowing as soon as possible so that you don’t end up wasting your time and can appropriately budget if need be.

<strong>Have cash handy.</strong> Occasionally, renting an apartment in NYC – especially a really nice one – may turn out to be a pretty quick transaction. You don’t want to miss out on the opportunity to snag the perfect place as soon as you see it (and get approved), so make sure you keep plenty of cash handy (typically in the form of a bank-certified check). Remember – along with first month’s rent and security, you’ll also need to pay the broker fee. In some cases, it might make sense to keep actual cash on hand to pay the broker right away to hold an apartment for you.

Above all else, take your time, do you homework and don’t be tempted to jump on the first decent place that comes along. The more effort you put into the search and selection process, the more likely you’ll be to end up in the apartment that’s perfect for you.
