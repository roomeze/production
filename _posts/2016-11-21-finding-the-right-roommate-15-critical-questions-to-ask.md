<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing an ideal roommate can be quite the challenge. After all, you’re going to have to share your living space with this person for who knows how long. One of the best ways to ensure that the person you end up renting a place with is a good fit with your preferences, lifestyle and personality is to spend time talking to each candidate and asking the right questions. If you’re in the process of looking for a new roommate, here are 15 critical things you should ask during the interview process.</span>

<b><i>How often do you clean? </i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest reasons roommates end up in conflict is cleaning (or lack thereof). It can be helpful to know in advance whether someone is likely to be a mismatch in this department – especially if you happen to be a neat freak. Asking how often a person cleans will usually provide better insight than coming right out and asking if they’re clean or not. Let them know your cleaning habits as well.</span>

<b><i>Do you smoke?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many, living with a smoker can be a deal breaker. Additionally, many leases specify whether or not smoking is allowed, so it’s important to ask this question in advance. If they say yes, ask them how often they smoke. An occasional cigarette in a social situation is a lot different than someone who smokes 3 packs a day. If you smoke, be sure to let your potential roommates know so they can also make an informed decision.  </span>

<b><i>What do you like to do in your spare time? </i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing ahead of time what kind of habits and hobbies a person has can be helpful in weeding out those who probably wouldn’t be a good fit. For instance, if you cherish your quiet time and the person you’re considering as a roommate plays the guitar in his or her spare time, it’s probably not going to work out very well. Again, share your own pastimes with each candidate as well. </span>

<b><i>Do you have a significant other?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important question to ask because the answer will indicate whether there will be an additional person hanging around a lot. This can mean you’ll be signing on for additional clutter, more utilities being used, more food being eaten, etc. – all things that can lead to conflict. If they are in a serious relationship and you’re ok with it, you might want to ask to meet their other half first to make sure it’s still a good fit for everyone. </span>

<b><i>Are you an early riser or a night owl?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep habits that don’t coincide can cause serious issues between roommates. If you have to be up at 5 am to get ready for work and your roommate is up making noise at all hours, chances are the situation is going to get old fast. Likewise, if you’re a night owl and your prospective roommate isn’t, you may want to consider finding someone whose schedule aligns more closely with yours. </span>

<b><i>What do you do for a living?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, this will let you know the person is gainfully employed and will be capable of meeting his or her obligations for rent and other bills. The answer to this question might also shed some light into the schedule and habits of the person in question. For example, a nurse that works 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shift will probably need a living space that is quiet during the day so he or she can sleep.  </span>

<b><i>Do you have pets or are you considering getting one?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the smoking question, living with someone who has a pet can be uncomfortable and lead to conflict. Furthermore, most apartments and rental homes have strict rules regarding pets, so it’s important to know this information ahead of time. If your place is pet-approved and you’re ok with it, you may want to consider asking for an additional pet deposit to cover any potential damages.</span>

<b><i>Do you like to have friends over or prefer to party elsewhere?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you’re up for all-night raves, you’ll probably want to find out in advance whether each candidate is the partying type. Occasional get-togethers are one thing, but regular group gatherings can become intrusive and lead to an uncomfortable and unpleasant living situation.</span>

<b><i>How often do you drink?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people drink socially. Others drink daily. Some prefer to go out to enjoy their adult beverages while others prefer to drink at home. This is an important thing to learn about your potential cohabitants because if you’re not both on the same page, it could end poorly. </span>

<b><i>Are you still friends with any of your former roommates?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship a person has with his or her former roommates can be indicative of how they’ll fare living with you. If they’ve burned bridges, it might be better to steer clear as well, otherwise you could end up in the same situation. </span>

<b><i>Do you have references?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it. Not everyone is honest. While most people you interview will be open and sincere, there’s always a chance someone will be misleading. You don’t want to find out after it’s too late. Ask for references – preferably of someone with whom they’ve lived previous to their current living situation – and check them…all of them.</span>

<b><i>How long are you planning to stay?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of choosing a roommate isn’t easy. The last thing you want is to have to go through it again a few months from now. Ask each candidate what their intentions are in terms of longevity. This can help you weed out those who wouldn’t be the best fit.</span>

<b><i>Have you had any challenges or issues living with roommates in the past? How did you handle them?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing a living space with someone isn’t always going to be sunshine and rainbows. Despite our greatest efforts, conflict can and probably will still occasionally arise. It’s how you handle those disagreements that will make or break your ability to cohabitate. Learning about how a potential roommate has handled uncomfortable living situations in the past can help determine whether they’re a good candidate or not.</span>

<b><i>What are you looking for in a roommate?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right roommate isn’t just about you. It’s about both people determining if it’s a good fit. You might think someone is ideal while he or she feels the opposite. Ask each candidate to share their thoughts and preferences to see if there’s a good match.</span>

<b><i>Is there anything else I should know?</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, ask each candidate to share any additional information about themselves that they feel would be pertinent. And, of course, you should do the same. Starting the relationship off with an open, honest and two-way dialogue can create a strong foundation for a positive and pleasant living situation. </span>
